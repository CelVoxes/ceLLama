## Installation

To install ceLLama, use the following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CelVoxes/ceLLama")
```

## Usage

#### Step 1: Install Ollama

Download [`Ollama`](https://ollama.com/).

#### Step 2: Choose Your Model

Select your preferred model. For instance, to run the Llama3 model, use
the following terminal command:

``` bash
ollama run llama3.1
```

This initiates a local server, which can be verified by visiting
<http://localhost:11434/>. The page should display “Ollama is running”.

#### Step 3: Annotate Cell Types

Load the required libraries and data:

``` r
library(Seurat)
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)

pbmc.data <- Read10X("../../Downloads/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/")

pbmc <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "pbmc3k", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)
pbmc[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")
pbmc <- subset(pbmc, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 2500 & percent.mt < 5)

# note that you can chain multiple commands together with %>%
pbmc <- pbmc %>%
    SCTransform(verbose = F) %>%
    RunPCA(verbose = F) %>%
    FindNeighbors(dims = 1:10, verbose = F) %>%
    FindClusters(resolution = 0.5, verbose = F) %>%
    RunUMAP(dims = 1:10, verbose = F)

DimPlot(pbmc, label = T, label.size = 3) + theme_void() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pbmc2700-1.png)<!-- -->

Identify cluster markers:

``` r
DefaultAssay(pbmc) <- "RNA"

# Find cluster markers
pbmc.markers <- FindAllMarkers(pbmc, verbose = F, min.pct = 0.5)

# split into a lists per cluster
pbmc.markers.list <- split(pbmc.markers, pbmc.markers$cluster)
```

Run ceLLama:

``` r
# set seed, make temperature 0 for reproducible results
library(ceLLama)

res <- ceLLama(pbmc.markers.list, temperature = 0, seed = 101, n_genes = 30)
```

    ## >> llama3.1 is being used with a temperature setting of 0

    ## >> Response: Activated T cells (CD4+ or CD8+)

    ## >> Response: Monocytes/Macrophages

    ## >> Response: CD8+ T cells

    ## >> Response: Activated B cells (Plasma Cells)

    ## >> Response: CD8+ T cells

    ## >> Response: CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells)

    ## >> Response: Monocyte/Macrophage

    ## >> Response: CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells)

    ## >> Response: Dendritic cells
    ## >> Response: Dendritic cells

> \[!TIP\]  
> Increase `temperature` to diversify outputs. Set different
> `base_prompt` to customize annotations.

Transfer the labels:

``` r
# transfer the labels
annotations <- map_chr(res, 1)

Idents(pbmc) <- "seurat_clusters"
names(annotations) <- levels(pbmc)
pbmc <- RenameIdents(pbmc, annotations)

DimPlot(pbmc, label = T, repel = T, label.size = 3) + theme_void() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) & NoLegend()
```

## Chain of Thought (Experimental)

Here, we can utilize [thinkR](https://github.com/eonurk/thinkR) package
for annotation. The goal of this approach is to leverage the modal’s
capabilities to break down complex reasoning processes into structured
steps. This stepwise decomposition in principle should allow for clear
annotations, capturing the intermediate thinking and decision-making
throughout an analysis or problem-solving task.

``` r
# devtools::install_github("eonurk/thinkR")
library(thinkR)
```

``` r
# use_thinkR = T
res <- ceLLama(pbmc.markers.list, temperature = 0, seed = 101, n_genes = 30, use_thinkR = T, 
               base_prompt = "This is from a PBMC dataset. Act like an expert immunologist and give me the cell type annotation for this cluster. ")

    ## ### Step 1 : 
    ## 
    ## Here is the first step of my reasoning chain:
    ## 
    ## ```
    ## {

    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## In this step, I have broken down the problem into its core components, which are:
    ## 
    ## 1. Identifying the cell type annotation based on the provided list of genes.
    ## 2. Analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated genes to determine their significance in identifying a specific immune cell type.
    ## 
    ## Next action: continue with gene analysis and pattern recognition.
    ## 
    ## ---
    ## 
    ## Step 2: Gene Analysis
    ## 
    ## ```
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Gene Analysis",
    ##   "content": "The list of up-regulated genes includes RPS3A, RPS27A, RPL9, RPL31, and others. These are ribosomal proteins involved in protein synthesis. Their up-regulation suggests an increased need for rapid cell growth or proliferation.",
    ##   "confidence": 85,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## In this step, I have analyzed the list of up-regulated genes to identify patterns related to cell growth and proliferation.
    ## 
    ## Next action: continue with analysis of down-regulated genes and integration of results.
    ## 
    ## ---
    ## 
    ## Step 3: Integration of Results
    ## 
    ## ```
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Integration of Results",
    ##   "content": "Considering both the up-regulated (e.g., ribosomal proteins) and down-regulated genes (e.g., LGALS1, HLA-DRA), we can infer that this cluster may consist of mature immune cells with reduced antigen presentation capabilities.",
    ##   "confidence": 90,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## In this step, I have integrated the results from both gene analyses to determine a more comprehensive understanding of the cell type annotation.
    ## 
    ## Next action: final analysis and determination of cell type.
    ## 
    ## ---
    ## 
    ## Step 4: Final Analysis
    ## 
    ## ```
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Final Analysis",
    ##   "content": "Taking into account the specific combination of up-regulated (ribosomal proteins) and down-regulated genes (e.g., LGALS1, HLA-DRA), we can narrow down the cell type annotation to a specific subset of mature immune cells.",

    ##   "next_action": "final_answer"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## In this step, I have conducted a final analysis of all the available data and determined that the most likely cell type annotation for cluster (0) is:

    ## 
    ## This response meets the guidelines. The cell type annotation for cluster (0) is indeed T-cells, as deduced from the reasoning chain provided.
    ## 
    ## Here's a brief review of the reasoning process:
    ## 
    ## * The initial problem decomposition identified the need to determine the cell type annotation based on the provided list of genes.
    ## * Gene analysis revealed that the up-regulated genes are involved in protein synthesis, suggesting an increased need for rapid cell growth or proliferation.
    ## * Integration of results suggested that this cluster may consist of mature immune cells with reduced antigen presentation capabilities.
    ## * Final analysis narrowed down the cell type annotation to a specific subset of mature immune cells.
    ## 
    ## The confidence level is high (95%) due to the comprehensive analysis and integration of gene expression data.

    ## 
    ## ### Final Answer
    ## 
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Final Answer",

    ## 
    ## ### Step 1 : 
    ## 
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Problem Decomposition",
    ##   "content": "This problem involves cell type annotation of a cluster based on gene expression data from a PBMC dataset.",
    ##   "confidence": 80,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## In this step, I've broken down the problem into its core components: identifying the cell type associated with the given up-regulated and down-regulated genes in a PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell) dataset.
    ## 
    ## Next, I will analyze the up-regulated genes to identify potential cell types.
    ## 
    ## **Time:** 13.18612408638 s
    ## 
    ## ---
    ## 
    ## ### Step 2 : 
    ## 
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Up-Regulated Genes Analysis",
    ##   "content": "The up-regulated genes S100A9, LYZ, and AIF1 are commonly associated with neutrophil granulocytes.",
    ##   "confidence": 85,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## Here, I've identified that the up-regulated genes S100A9, LYZ, and AIF1 are often found in neutrophils. This suggests a potential cell type annotation.
    ## 
    ## Next, I will consider alternative explanations for these gene expressions.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Alternative Explanations",
    ##   "content": "While the up-regulated genes suggest neutrophil involvement, it's essential to consider other possible cell types that could express similar sets of genes.",
    ##   "confidence": 60,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## This step acknowledges that there might be other cell types that could exhibit a similar gene expression profile.
    ## 
    ## Now, I will analyze the down-regulated genes for potential clues.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Down-Regulated Genes Analysis",
    ##   "content": "The down-regulated genes IL32 and LTB are often associated with T cells, particularly after activation.",
    ##   "confidence": 70,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## Here, I've found that the down-regulated genes IL32 and LTB are commonly seen in activated T cells. This could indicate a suppression of T cell activity in this cluster.
    ## 
    ## Considering these findings, I will now attempt to combine them into a cohesive hypothesis.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Hypothesis Formation",
    ##   "content": "Based on the up-regulated neutrophil genes and down-regulated T cell genes, it's possible that this cluster contains a subset of cells transitioning from a T cell-like state to a more mature neutrophil phenotype.",
    ##   "confidence": 75,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## This step attempts to synthesize the information gathered so far into a testable hypothesis.
    ## 
    ## Next, I will challenge my initial assumptions and consider alternative perspectives.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Challenge Assumptions",
    ##   "content": "Upon reevaluation, it's essential to consider whether these gene expressions could be indicative of other cell types or processes.",
    ##   "confidence": 50,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## This step acknowledges the limitations of my previous reasoning and encourages further exploration.
    ## 
    ## Now, I will address potential LLM (Large Language Model) shortcomings.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Addressing LLM Limitations",
    ##   "content": "Given the complexity of immune cell biology, it's crucial to recognize that our current understanding is based on incomplete knowledge. Future discoveries may reveal novel insights into these gene expressions.",
    ##   "confidence": 40,
    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## This step highlights the need for ongoing research and acknowledges the inherent limitations of our current understanding.
    ## 
    ## Next, I will quantify my confidence level in this hypothesis.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Confidence Quantification",
    ##   "content": "While there are compelling arguments supporting a neutrophil or transitioning T cell-like phenotype, I assign a confidence level of 65% to this hypothesis.",
    ##   "confidence": 65,
    ##   "next_action": "final_answer"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## This step provides a numerical assessment of the confidence in my hypothesis.
    ## 
    ## Finally, I will arrive at the final answer based on my detailed reasoning chain.
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Final Answer",

    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 1:** **Gene Expression Pattern Analysis**
    ## The up-regulation of chemokines (e.g., CCL5) and cytotoxic molecules (e.g., GZMA, JUN) suggests an active immune response.

    ## **Time:** 13.2188730239868 s

    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 2:** **Cell Type Hypotheses**
    ## Considering the expression of chemokines and cytotoxic molecules, potential cell types include:
    ## - T lymphocytes (CD3E, CD7, CD3D), particularly those involved in cell-mediated immunity.
    ## - Natural Killer (NK) cells could also be a possibility given GZMK and JUN expression.
    ## 
    ## **Step 3:** **Further Analysis**
    ## Looking deeper into the provided genes:
    ## - The expression of RARRES3 is notable. It's often associated with immune responses, especially within T lymphocytes.
    ## - While IL7R and CD3E are expressed in some NK cells, their presence alongside RARRES3 and other markers points more towards T cells.
    ## 
    ## **Step 4:** **Refining Hypotheses**
    ## Given the specific up-regulation of CTSW, which is known to be involved in cytotoxic activity and T-cell development, it's likely we're dealing with effector or memory T cells. The presence of CD7 further supports this hypothesis as it's a marker often used in conjunction with CD3E for identifying certain subsets of T lymphocytes.
    ## 
    ## **Step 5:** **Conclusion**
    ## Based on the combined analysis of gene expression patterns and their implications, the most likely cell type associated with this cluster is:

    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Problem Decomposition",

    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 1: Gene Expression Pattern Analysis**
    ## 
    ## Analyzing the list of up-regulated and down-regulated genes, I notice that many are related to cytotoxic functions, such as GRANULES (GNLY, NKG7, GZMB, PRF1), Cytokine-chemokines signaling pathways (FGFBP2, CCL4, CST7, CCL5, XCL2), and HLA class I molecules (HLA-C, HLA-A). This suggests a possible lymphoid lineage.

    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Cytotoxic Gene Expression Pattern",
    ##   "content": "The presence of cytotoxic gene products (e.g., perforin, granzymes) may indicate an effector cell function.",

    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 2: Cytokine and Chemokine Signaling**
    ## 
    ## The up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines like FGFBP2, CCL4, CST7, CCL5, XCL2 could imply a role in cell-to-cell communication, immune regulation, or recruitment of other cells to the site of action. This might further support the lymphoid lineage hypothesis.
    ## 
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "Cytokine and Chemokine Signaling",
    ##   "content": "The up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines may indicate a role in immune regulation, cell-to-cell communication, or recruitment of other cells.",

    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 3: HLA Class I Molecule Expression**
    ## 
    ## The presence of HLA class I molecules (HLA-C, HLA-A) suggests an antigen-presenting cell function. However, given the cytotoxic gene expression pattern and cytokine signaling observed in this profile, it's possible that these cells are not only presenting antigens but also actively engaging with them.
    ## 
    ## ```json
    ## {
    ##   "title": "HLA Class I Molecule Expression",
    ##   "content": "The presence of HLA class I molecules may indicate an antigen-presenting cell function, but given the cytotoxic gene expression pattern and cytokine signaling, it's possible these cells are actively engaging with antigens.",

    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 4: Lymphoid Lineage Inference**
    ## 
    ## Considering all the evidence from cytotoxic gene expression, cytokine signaling, HLA class I molecule presence, and cell cluster characteristics (from PBMC dataset), it seems plausible to infer a lymphoid lineage. However, further differentiation within this lineage is required.
    ## 
    ## ```json
    ## {

    ##   "next_action": "continue"
    ## }
    ## ```
    ## 
    ## **Step 5: Differentiation Within Lymphoid Lineage**
    ## 
    ## Given the presence of cytotoxic and cytokine-related genes along with HLA class I molecules, the most likely cell type within the lymphoid lineage could be Natural Killer (NK) cells. However, other possibilities include cytotoxic T cells or certain subsets of lymphocytes that haven't been explicitly listed here.
    ##

## Using OpenAI API

> \[!WARNING\]  
> This will send data to OpenAI!

You can also use OpenAI for annotating your cell types. First, you can
to create a `.Renviron` file where you keep your API key.
`OPENAI_API_KEY="Best_key_ever"`

``` r
# Default is gpt-4o-mini
res.openai <-
    ceLLama(pbmc.markers.list, temperature = 0, seed = 101, n_genes = 30,
        use_openai = T, # money brr.
        model = "gpt-4o-mini", # set the model
        openai_api_key = Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # or just copy/paste
    )
```

    ## >> gpt-4o-mini is being used with a temperature setting of 0

    ## >> Response: T cell

    ## >> Response: Monocyte/Macrophage

    ## >> Response: CD4+ T cells

    ## >> Response: B cell

    ## >> Response: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)

    ## >> Response: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)

    ## >> Response: Monocyte/Macrophage

    ## >> Response: Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells

    ## >> Response: Dendritic cells

    ## >> Response: Megakaryocyte

``` r
# transfer the labels
annotations <- map_chr(res.openai, 1)

Idents(pbmc) <- "seurat_clusters"
names(annotations) <- levels(pbmc)
pbmc <- RenameIdents(pbmc, annotations)

DimPlot(pbmc, label = T, repel = T, label.size = 3) + theme_void() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) & NoLegend()
```

## Creating Reports

Generate detailed reports explaining the annotations:

``` r
# Get the reason for the annotation! (a bit slower)
res <- ceLLama(pbmc.markers.list, temperature = 0, seed = 101, get_reason = T)

# These creates html report in the current directory
generate_report_md(res)
create_html_report()
```
